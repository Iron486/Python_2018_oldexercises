# Python_2018_oldexercises

Some Python exercises that I completed between 2017 and 2018 in order to practise with the programming language.
Majority of the programs were realized using Tkinter (Python GUI).

[giocodell8.py](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/gioco_dell8.py) is a *8 puzzle* with a chronometer,a random scrambler, a move counter and 
a section that shows the stats on the previous resolution times. [video_giocodell'8.mp4](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/video_giocodell'8.mp4) is a video demonstration.

[Calcolo.py](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/calcolo.py) calculates the maximum observable distance of a peak of a specific height on the earth, given the height of the point in which the observer is located. It also calculates the slope between two points at different heights (I used this program also for a school project).

[Ratio_of_Fibonacci_series.py](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/Ratio_of_Fibonacci_series.py) is a simple programs that simulates the Fibonacci ratio and plots a graph given a certain number of iterations of the ratio.

[curva_ipsografica_profilo_topografico.py](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/curva_ipsografica_profilo_topografico.py) is a program that plots the ipsographic curve of a drainage basin and a topographic profile given some input height data.

[equation.py](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/equation.py) represents in the Cartesian plane a maximum of 2 mathematical functions given as an input.

[Inequalities.py](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/Inequalities.py) is a program that solves inequalities.

[latex_converting.py](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/latex_converting.py) converts a function from Python format to Latex.

[PROGRAMMA_DI_SCRAMBLE.py](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/PROGRAMMA_DI_SCRAMBLE.py) generates optimal random scrambles for Rubik's cube and some other puzzles.

[Rubik.py](https://github.com/Iron486/Python_2018_oldexercises/blob/main/Rubik.py) that generates a random scramble for the Rubik's cube and some other 3d teasers, with a Tkinter interface; and calculates the time that it takes to solve the puzzle along with some statistical parameters.

<ins>NB</ins>(1) : Some files can have some troubles working because previous versions of Python were used.

<ins>NB</ins>(2) : The code sometimes might not be written in an optimal way, since some scripts were coded when I was approaching Python for the first time.
