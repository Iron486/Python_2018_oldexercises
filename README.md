# Python_2018_oldexercises

Some Python exercises that I completed between 2017 and 2018 in order to practise with the programming language.
Majority of the programs were realized using Tkinter (Python GUI).

"giocodell8.py" is a 8 puzzle with a chronometer,a random scrambler, a move counter and a calculator 
of some statistical parameters according to the previous solution times. "video_giocodell'8.mp4" is a video demonstration.

"Calcolo.py" calculates the maximum observable distance of a peak of a specific height on the earth and given the height of the point in which the observer is located. It also calculates the slope between the points at different heights (I used this program also for a school project).

"Ratio_of_Fibonacci_series.py" is a simple programs that simulates the Fibonacci ratio and plots a graph given a certain number of iterations.

"curva_ipsografica_profilo_topografico.py" is a program that plots the ipsographic curve of a drainage basin and a topographic profile given some input height data.

"equation.py" represents a maximum of 1 or 2 mathematical functions given as an input.

"Inequalities.py" is a program that solves inequalities.

"latex_converting.py" converts a function from Python format to Latex.

"PROGRAMMA_DI_SCRAMBLE.py" generates optimal random scrambles for Rubik's cube and some other puzzles.

"Rubik.py" generates a random scramble for the Rubik's cube and some other puzzles with a Tkinter interface, calculating the time for each solution and some statistical variables.
